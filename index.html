    <p>A device that will make the Telegraph useless due to we are able to send our own voices to them now. The technology has been made which is able to send our one voices through lines to other people when we use only Telegraph for communications.</p>
    <p>This can help increase the speed of information being transferred by talking and not using morse code which needs to be written down. Also people can talking away from each other even with out any knowledge of how to use the device, unlike a Telegraph.</p>
    <p>This can be used in many different ways to help speed up and/or make things possible. The military are able to use telephones to talk to commanders at bases, people are able to talk to their relatives which live far away, or even close.</p>
    <p>The telephone works by amplifying the signal then sending it down a wire which can heard by the receiver of the call. The design can be tweaked and changed in the future to better fit different things. Like a group of people talking to single person about business or just simple things like how was their day.</p>
